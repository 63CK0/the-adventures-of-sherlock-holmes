<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and
ran thus:</p><p>"DEAR MR. HOLMES:--I am very anxious to consult you as to whether
I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered
to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I
do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,
                                               "VIOLET HUNTER."</p><p>"Do you know the young lady?" I asked.</p><p>"Not I."</p><p>"It is half-past ten now."</p><p>"Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring."</p><p>"It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You
remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to
be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation.
It may be so in this case, also."</p></div> </div>
