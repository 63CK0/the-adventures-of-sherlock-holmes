it is that I have received a letter from him to-day."</p><p>Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been
galvanised.</p><p>"What!" he roared.</p><p>"Yes, to-day." She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of
paper in the air.</p><p>"May I see it?"</p><p>"Certainly."</p><p>He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out
upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I
had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The
envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend
postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day
before, for it was considerably after midnight.</p></div> </div>
