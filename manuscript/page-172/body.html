<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> That was
last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything
since then to throw any light upon what became of him."</p><p>"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated," said
Holmes.</p><p>"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all
the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to
be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to
separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him,
and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed
strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since
gives a meaning to it."</p></div> </div>
