money," said he, "and he enjoyed the use of the money of the
daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable

her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would
not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would
mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her

keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of
people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not
answer forever.</p></div> </div>
