which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from
a book. It was headed, "March, 1869," and beneath were the
following enigmatical notices:</p><p>"4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.</p><p>"7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and
      John Swain, of St. Augustine.</p><p>"9th. McCauley cleared.</p><p>"10th. John Swain cleared.</p><p>"12th. Visited Paramore. All well."</p><p>"Thank you!" said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it
to our visitor. "And now you must on no account lose another
instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told
me. You must get home instantly and act."</p></div> </div>
