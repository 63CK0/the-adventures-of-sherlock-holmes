cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,"
he said. "If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know
when you have done it."</p><p>"Certainly," said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in
the door. "I let you know, then, that I have caught him!"</p><p>"What! where?" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips
and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.</p><p>"Oh, it won't do--really it won't," said Holmes suavely. "There
is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too
transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that
it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's
