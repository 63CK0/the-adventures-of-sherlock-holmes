received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his
departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable

got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through
Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me
so far?"</p><p>"It is very clear."</p></div> </div>
