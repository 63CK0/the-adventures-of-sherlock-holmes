geese which you supplied to the Alpha."</p><p>"Well then, I shan't tell you. So now!"</p><p>"Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don't know why you
should be so warm over such a trifle."</p><p>"Warm! You'd be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am.
When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end
of the business; but it's 'Where are the geese?' and 'Who did you
sell the geese to?' and 'What will you take for the geese?' One
would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the
fuss that is made over them."</p></div> </div>
