three fields round his house, and there he would take his
exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave

was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be
fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would
make me his representative both with the servants and with the
tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite
master of the house.</p></div> </div>
