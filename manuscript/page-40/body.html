Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of
disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it

emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old.
Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in
front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.</p><p>"Well, really!" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again

chair.</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I
employed my morning, or what I ended by doing."</p></div> </div>
