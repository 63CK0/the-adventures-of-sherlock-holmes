<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the
maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran
in this way:</p><p>"Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from
the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy.
Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect.
Leave Paddington by the 11:15."</p><p>"What do you say, dear?" said my wife, looking across at me.
"Will you go?"</p><p>"I really don't know what to say. I have a fairly long list at
present."</p><p>"Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking
a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good,
and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases."</p></div> </div>
