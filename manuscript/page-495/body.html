seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and
marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other

fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old
bird of prey.</p><p>"Which of you is Holmes?" asked this apparition.</p><p>"My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me," said my
companion quietly.</p><p>"I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran."</p><p>"Indeed, Doctor," said Holmes blandly. "Pray take a seat."</p><p>"I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I
have traced her. What has she been saying to you?"</p></div> </div>
